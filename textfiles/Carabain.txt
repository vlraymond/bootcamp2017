High Lord Carabain exists only to oppress his subjects. His end goald is nothing less but the total consolidation of power within <NATION>, where no one even dares think of fighting him.  He rules <NATION> not with an army, but with a network of spies constantly informing on the actions of his people. Carabain himself rarely lifts a finger, but to steer against him is a slow death. Those who oppose him may not even realize they are under attack, but soon realize that the world they know is turned against them. Former partners are compelled to distance themselves and disavow their friendship, while business and home are attacked by nefarious means. Soon all who oppose Carabain are left without work, home and friends, and fade into obscurity as Carabain perpetuates even more crimes against his people under the cover of oppressive disinformation.
